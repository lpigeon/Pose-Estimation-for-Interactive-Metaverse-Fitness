# Keyboard shortcuts

You can use keyboard shortcuts to access or refine many of the tool actions that are available with the Polybrush package. 

This page gives an overview of those shortcuts. Where a command has Ctrl/Command as part of the keystroke, use the Ctrl key on Windows and the Command key on macOS. Similarly, where a command has Alt/Option as part of the keystroke, use the Alt key on Windows and either the Alt or Option key on macOS, depending on your keyboard.
