- Fix bug where script reloads would null-ify texture mode brush color and not properly reset it.
- Fix errors in brush event logic that caused OnBrushEnter/Move/Exit to be called at incorrect times with invalid targets, resulting in crashes when editing prefabs with multiple meshes with different shaders
- Fix undo throwing errors when splat_cache is null.
- Clamp radius max value to min+.001 to avoid crashes when scrolling radius shortcut with equal min/max values.
- Fix uv3/4 not applying or applying to incorrect mesh channels in ProBuilder (requires update to ProBuilder 2.5.1).
