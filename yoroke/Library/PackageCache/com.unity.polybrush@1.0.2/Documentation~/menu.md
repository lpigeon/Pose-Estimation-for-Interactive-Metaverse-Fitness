The following features are available from this menu:

| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Polybrush Window**                 | Opens the [Polybrush window](index.md#interface), which you can use to select and customize [brush modes](modes.md), change the brush [size and intensity](brushes.md), and choose any [mirroring options](brush_mirror.md). |
| **Bake Vertex Streams**              | Opens the **Bake Vertex Streams** window which lists the Polybrush Mesh data for the selected GameObject on the **Selected** pane. You can then specify what to do with this data in the **Bake Options** pane. <br /><br />![](images/BakeVertexStreams.png)<br /><br />**Note:** This feature has been deprecated and will be removed in future versions of the package. |
